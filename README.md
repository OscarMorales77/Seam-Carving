Seam Carving - Java, Dijkstra's algorithm, Iterables, Pixel Energy Function  
A content-aware image resizing application where an image is reduced in size while preserving the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. This is a classic shortest path problem in an edge-weighted digraph. Because an image is ultimately a set of pixels, a picture can be modeled as graph where each pixel is a vertex with three directed, outward edges that point to neighboring pixels. The “edge-weight” (for a given pixel) is the energy measure of its neighboring pixels. The energy measure represents the relative importance of a pixel (calculated by the gradient energy function).
